# Resistance-On-Python

I tried to implement the resistance card game on Python. This was part of my projectwork for the IT in Finance course at Politecnico di Milano Graduate School of Management. 

The rules of the game are:

1. There are 7 players - two spies and 5 civilians.
2. The spies aim to sabotage the game by putting in the picture cards.
3. The civilians can save the game by voting out players after each round.
4. Whichever team wins the more rounds out of 5 wins.
5. In the first round, there are 3 players. In the second and third round, there are 4 players. In the fourth and fifth round, there are 5 players.

The project was in steps. I tried to employ different strategies, each at a time to improve the chances of each team winning. 
I think the project was a success. However, I will certainly be making improvements to this in the future. Behaviors of each players can be added in order to make the game more realistic and entertaining.
